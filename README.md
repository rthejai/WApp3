# WApp3
For TINFO 431A by Thejai Riem

For my project in this class I will be working alone. This means that I will solely be in charge of all development. I plan to of course use ASP.NET MVC 5, HTML for front-end development, manage a database, and maybe in the end host it all on cloud using Microsoft Azure. The theme of the site will be a computer parts site like Newegg.com. There will be a shopping cart, pages to browse products, accounts to register for, and will utilize CSS and Jquery to facelift the front-end of the website even more than what HTML alone can do. Inheritance will be used for creating an account that will then can be upgraded to a premium member or an administrator account.
